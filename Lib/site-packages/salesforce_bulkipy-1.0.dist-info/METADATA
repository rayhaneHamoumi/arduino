Description: # Salesforce Bulkipy
        
        A Python library for the Salesforce Bulk API (that actually works)
        
        ## Changes over [salesforce-bulk](https://github.com/heroku/salesforce-bulk)
        
        The [salesforce-bulk](https://github.com/heroku/salesforce-bulk) library was used to export 18k records to [Wingify](https://github.com/wingify)'s Salesforce system. Even though the library was super useful, it's broken, not maintained anymore and was a pain to work with while figuring out the bugs. [@bholagabbar](https://github.com/bholagabbar) decided to fix all the issues faced and release a new, usable library **salesforce-bulkipy**. This library has been tested successfully on our Salesforce Sandbox.
        
        * Added support for [Two-Factor Authentication](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.identityImplGuide.meta/identityImplGuide/security_require_two-factor_authentication.htm) by routing authentication via [simple-salesforce](https://github.com/simple-salesforce/simple-salesforce)
        * Added support for [Salesforce Sandbox](https://test.salesforce.com)
        * Added support for parsing unicode characters in CSV
        * Fixed various other bugs
        
        **salesforce-bulkipy** will be actively maintained, unlike salesforce-bulk
        
        ## Installation
        
        **```sudo pip install salesforce-bulkipy```** (not yet available)
        
        Incase your setup fails, you may have a few essential tools missing. Try
        `sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev`
        
        
        ## Authentication
        
        To access the Bulk API, you need to authenticate a user into Salesforce. There are 2 possible ways to achieve this. These methods work irrespective of whether your organisation has [Two-Factor Authentication](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.identityImplGuide.meta/identityImplGuide/security_require_two-factor_authentication.htm) enabled or not, so that's a massive overhead taken care of.
        
        ##### The code samples shown read credentials from a [config.properties](https://docs.python.org/2/library/configparser.html) file. Feel free to adapt the input method to your setting
        
        #### 1. username, password, [security_token](https://success.salesforce.com/answers?id=90630000000glADAAY)
        ```
        from salesforce_bulkipy import SalesforceBulkipy
        import ConfigParser
        
        config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser()
        config.read('config.properties')
        
        username = config.get('Section', 'username')
        password = config.get('Section', 'password')
        security_token = config.get('Section', 'security_token')
        
        bulk = SalesforceBulkipy(username=username, password=password, security_token=security_token) #optional parameter: sandbox=True
        
        # Authentication Successful!
        ```
        
        #### 2. session_id, host
        ```
        from salesforce_bulkipy import SalesforceBulkipy
        import ConfigParser
        
        config = ConfigParser.RawConfigParser()
        config.read('config.properties')
        
        session_id = config.get('Section', 'session_id')
        session_id = config.get('Section', 'session_id')
        
        bulk = SalesforceBulkipy(session_id=session_id, host=host) #optional parameter: sandbox=True
        
        # Authentication Successful!
        ```
        
        ## Operations
        
        The basic sequence for driving the Bulk API is:
        
        1. Create a new job
        2. Add one or more batches to the job
        3. Wait for each batch to finish
        4. Close the job
        
        ## Bulk Insert, Update, Delete
        
        All Bulk upload operations work the same. You set the operation when you create the
        job. Then you submit one or more documents that specify records with columns to
        insert/update/delete. When deleting you should only submit the Id for each record.
        
        For efficiency you should use the `post_bulk_batch` method to post each batch of
        data. (Note that a batch can have a maximum 10,000 records and be 1GB in size.)
        You pass a generator or iterator into this function and it will stream data via
        POST to Salesforce. For help sending CSV formatted data you can use the
        salesforce_bulk.CsvDictsAdapter class. It takes an iterator returning dictionaries
        and returns an iterator which produces CSV data.
        
        
        **Concurrency mode**: When creating the job, you can pass `concurrency=Serial` or `concurrency=Parallel` to set the
        concurrency mode for the job.
        
        
        ## Bulk Insert Example
        
        ```
        from salesforce_bulkipy import SalesforceBulkipy
        from salesforce_bulkipy import CsvDictsAdapter
        
        bulk = SalesforceBulkipy(username=username, password=password, security_token=security_token)
        
        records_to_insert = [{}, {}]  # A list of A Custom Object dict
        
        # Bulk Insert
        job = bulk.create_insert_job("CustomObjectName", contentType='CSV')
        csv_iter = CsvDictsAdapter(iter(records_to_insert))
        batch = bulk.post_bulk_batch(job, csv_iter)
        bulk.wait_for_batch(job, batch)
        bulk.close_job(job)
        ```
        
        
        ## Bulk Query Example
        
        ```
        from salesforce_bulkipy import SalesforceBulkipy
        
        bulk = SalesforceBulkipy(username=username, password=password, security_token=security_token)
        
        records_to_insert = [{}, {}]  # A list of A Custom Object dict
        
        # Bulk Query
        query = '' # SOQL Query
        job = bulk.create_query_job("PushCrew_Account__c", contentType='CSV')
        batch = bulk.query(job, query)
        bulk.wait_for_batch(job, batch)
        bulk.close_job(job)
        # Result
        results = bulk.get_batch_result_iter(job, batch, parse_csv=True)
        ```
